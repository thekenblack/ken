# Kyoiku Kanji 1 (en)

- For 'On' and 'Kun(Alone)', there is no explanation. It's because they have almost same meanings with glyph's meaning in many cases. For example, the glyph '草' might be read like 'ソウ' or 'くさ', but eventually they have similar meanings like 'grass' anyway. In that case, it's just matter of the way of readings, rather than having different meanings. The way of readings varies much depending on the words.
	- But for 'Kun(Base-Kana)', each readings might have very different meanings. For example, '生きる(い-きる)' means 'to live', and '生まれる(う-まれる)' means 'to be born', which are very different. Thus there are explanations for them.
	- Also, if it needs some additional explanations, notes should be preferred, rather than the table (due to the insufficiency of space).
- 'Kyu' means 'Kyujitai(旧字体)', which means the original glyph. The opposite is 'Shinjitai(新字体)', which is Japanese simplified characters. Actually, Kyujitai might feel a bit irrelevant for beginners, but showing this here has generally two purposes:
	- For people who already know some traditional languages from other languages, showing Kyujitai might help their studying, making connections to Shinjitai.
		- However, for people who don't know traditional characters, Kyujitai might just feels like a burden, since they have complex shapes in most cases. If that's the case, you can just simply ignore it. Consider it like a hint for the future studying. Because there's still a chance of facing Kyujitai characters in Japanese language.
	- Covering some rare cases; especially names. (human names, goods names, place names, etc.)
		- Defining Shinjitai is mostly for simplifying the daily words. If some name contains Kyujitai, the characters might remain same, unless they change it. At that time, you can relate those unfamiliar characters to relatively common characters you know, rather than considering them like completely new characters.

## 上

- あ-げる/あ-がる
  - These forms are commonly used. "あ-げる" is a transitive verb meaning "to raise" or "to lift," while "あ-がる" is an intransitive verb meaning "to rise" or "to go up."
- のぼ-る
  - "のぼ-る" means "to climb" or "to go up" and has a strong sense of action. The commonly used kanji for it are "上る," "登る," and "昇る," each with different nuances:
    - 上る: A neutral term for moving from a lower place to a higher place, such as climbing stairs.
    - 登る: Suggests climbing a steep surface, such as a mountain or a cliff. It can also be used for stepping onto a stage or platform.
    - 昇る: Implies that something capable of flying or floating rises, such as the sun, birds, or smoke.
- のぼ-せる
  - Like "あ-げる," it means "to raise," but "のぼ-せる" is more abstract. It is often used for things like achievements or ranks.
- のぼ-す
  - Has the same basic meaning as "のぼ-せる" but is rarely used. "のぼ-せる" is more common in everyday speech, while "のぼ-す" has a more literary or formal tone.

- さ-げる/さ-がる
  - "さ-げる" is a transitive verb meaning "to lower," while "さ-がる" is an intransitive verb meaning "to go down."
- くだ-る/くだ-す
  - "くだ-る" is an intransitive verb meaning "to go down," while "くだ-す" is a transitive verb meaning "to lower" or "to issue." Unlike "さ-げる/さ-がる," these verbs can also have figurative meanings, such as "to issue an order".
- くだ-さる
  - A polite form meaning "to give" (used when receiving something from a superior).
- お-ろす/お-りる
  - "お-ろす" has a nuance of physically lowering or taking something down, such as "pulling down pants."

  - "い-る" is often seen in forms like "入" or "入り" and pronounced as "いり," as in 入口/入り口(いりぐち, entrance).

---
